# Kartographer

## Game Concept

Kartographer is a co-op extraction-survival fusion game about driving and upgrading a golf cart through a desert wasteland. Players will drive past abandoned buildings where they can stop and enter the buildings to find various parts to either repair or upgrade their cart. As players drive, they will unlock new parts of the map. Eventually, players will pass by extraction points where they can choose to extract and save their cart upgrades and map progress, trade upgrades, or continue driving and risk losing all their progress. However, players must continue driving to outrun the dangerous storm.
